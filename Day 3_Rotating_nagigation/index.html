           <p>Reminding KCR of his own words that Telangana would not have become a reality without the support of Gandhi, Sravan demanded that it was high time the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi government returned the respect to the UPA chairperson.

            "Since for the great contribution and commitment, it is our prime responsibility to honour Smt Sonia Gandhi for a memorable gift given to all of us. Although KCR is the first beneficiary of the separate state, he didn't show any interest to respect Smt Sonia Gandhi (sic)...," he said.
